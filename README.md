# Tornado Game

## Overview

As the game is played in the terminal/CLI I decided the target audience would be technology/computer enthusiasts 
(as they will have to have at least some knowledge of this to play the game in the first place) who enjoy guessing games, and computer games in general. I then came up with an alternative theme/imagery to give the game extra interest.

## Goals

### Organisation Aims

-   Create a variation on the traditional hangman game using a different theme & imagery
-   Make the the game easy to play and rules unambigious
-   Allow the user to chose the difficulty of the words used in the game


### User Stories

- I want the game to be intuative to understand and play
- I want to be able to continue playing or finish the game when I choose
- I want the game to be visually appealing
- I want to know the word after losing
- I want to be able to choose the difficulty of the game

## Game Development

My overall plan for the game was to create a hangman type game with it's own style. Due to the nature of it being played in the terminal this made me think about using a retro, arcade type of aesthetic for the game. I searched for ASCII art and came up with the idea of using a tornado approaching a house, getting closer everytime the user guesses incorrectly. Implementing all this would enable the game to meet all user stories.

### Game Planning

Due to the nature of the game being command line the first step in the planning phase wasn't to wireframe but rather to create a flow chart that would enable me to implement the logic for the game into my python code and take it from there:
